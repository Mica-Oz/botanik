              <h2>Comprehensive Family Law Services in Colorado</h2>
              <p>
                When your family faces a legal challenge, you need an attorney who combines sophisticated legal expertise with genuine compassion for what you're experiencing. At Neiley & Morris, our Colorado family law attorneys provide comprehensive representation for families throughout the Western Slope and mountain communities, from Telluride to Aspen to Rifle and beyond.
              </p>

              <p>
                Family law matters are rarely just legal issues—they're deeply personal situations that affect your children, your financial security, and your future. Our boutique practice ensures you receive focused, personalized attention throughout the process. Your attorney will know every detail of your case and remain personally involved from consultation through resolution.
              </p>

              <h2>Divorce and Legal Separation</h2>
              <p>
                Divorce represents one of life's most significant transitions. Whether you're facing a straightforward dissolution or a complex divorce involving substantial assets, our attorneys provide the guidance and advocacy you need to navigate this challenging process.
              </p>

              <h3>High-Asset and Complex Marital Estates</h3>
              <p>
                Colorado's mountain communities present unique challenges in divorce cases. Our attorneys regularly handle sophisticated divorces involving:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Luxury Real Estate:</strong> Dividing marital estates that include mountain homes, ski-in/ski-out properties, vacation homes, and investment real estate across multiple locations</li>
                <li><strong>Business Interests:</strong> Working with forensic accountants and business valuation experts to accurately value and divide interests in closely-held businesses, professional practices, and partnerships</li>
                <li><strong>Investment Portfolios:</strong> Addressing complex investment holdings including stocks, bonds, retirement accounts, trusts, and alternative investments</li>
                <li><strong>Executive Compensation:</strong> Handling stock options, restricted stock units, deferred compensation, bonuses, and performance incentives</li>
                <li><strong>Inherited Wealth:</strong> Protecting separate property including inheritances, trust interests, and family wealth passed down through generations</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Same-Sex Divorce and Legal Separation</h3>
              <p>
                We provide experienced representation for LGBTQ+ couples navigating divorce or legal separation. Same-sex divorces present unique considerations regarding property acquired before marriage became legal, parental rights when biology may not align with parentage, and complex custody arrangements. Our attorneys understand these nuances and advocate effectively for our LGBTQ+ clients.
              </p>

              <h3>Spousal Support and Modifications</h3>
              <p>
                Spousal maintenance (alimony) in Colorado depends on numerous factors including marriage length, income disparity, age, health, and earning capacity. Our attorneys negotiate fair spousal support arrangements or litigate when necessary to ensure appropriate outcomes. We also handle modifications when circumstances change significantly, such as job loss, retirement, remarriage, or substantial income changes.
              </p>

              <h3>The Colorado Divorce Process</h3>
              <p>
                Colorado is a no-fault divorce state, meaning neither spouse needs to prove wrongdoing. However, this doesn't mean divorce is simple. The process involves:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Meeting Colorado's 91-day residency requirement</li>
                <li>Filing and serving divorce petitions</li>
                <li>Financial disclosures and mandatory financial statements</li>
                <li>Temporary orders hearings for immediate issues</li>
                <li>Discovery and information gathering</li>
                <li>Mediation or settlement negotiations</li>
                <li>Trial if settlement cannot be reached</li>
                <li>Final decree and permanent orders</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Our attorneys guide you through each stage, ensuring your rights are protected and your voice is heard throughout the process.
              </p>

              <h2>Parenting Rights and Responsibilities</h2>
              <p>
                Colorado law focuses on the best interests of children when determining custody, parenting time, and decision-making authority. Our attorneys prioritize your children's wellbeing while advocating for parenting arrangements that work for your family.
              </p>

              <h3>Allocation of Parental Responsibilities</h3>
              <p>
                In Colorado, "custody" is called "allocation of parental responsibilities" (APR). This includes both parenting time (physical custody) and decision-making responsibilities (legal custody). Our attorneys help you navigate:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Parenting Time Schedules:</strong> Creating practical schedules that work with work commitments, school calendars, and the realities of mountain community life</li>
                <li><strong>Decision-Making:</strong> Determining how major decisions about education, healthcare, religion, and extracurricular activities will be made</li>
                <li><strong>Holiday and Vacation Schedules:</strong> Developing fair arrangements for holidays, school breaks, and summer vacations</li>
                <li><strong>Transportation and Exchange:</strong> Addressing logistics when parents live in different mountain towns or across substantial distances</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Same-Sex Parenting Rights</h3>
              <p>
                Parental rights for same-sex couples require careful attention to ensure both parents' rights are protected. We assist with:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Establishing legal parentage for non-biological parents</li>
                <li>Second-parent adoption when necessary</li>
                <li>Parenting plans that recognize both parents' equal rights</li>
                <li>Protecting parental rights when relationships end</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Child Support and Expenses</h3>
              <p>
                Colorado uses income-based guidelines to calculate child support, considering:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Both parents' gross incomes</li>
                <li>Number of children</li>
                <li>Parenting time division</li>
                <li>Healthcare costs</li>
                <li>Work-related childcare expenses</li>
                <li>Extraordinary expenses</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Our attorneys ensure accurate income calculations (especially important with variable income common among Western Slope professionals), appropriate consideration of non-ordinary expenses, and modifications when circumstances change substantially.
              </p>

              <h3>Relocation and Removal</h3>
              <p>
                When a parent wishes to relocate with children, Colorado law requires strict procedures. Whether you're seeking to relocate or opposing a proposed move, our attorneys provide experienced representation in these high-stakes cases. Relocation disputes often involve questions of job opportunities, family support, educational advantages, and maintaining meaningful relationships with both parents.
              </p>

              <h3>Modification of Parenting Plans</h3>
              <p>
                Life changes. When circumstances change substantially, parenting plans may need modification. We handle modifications based on:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Job changes or relocation</li>
                <li>Remarriage and new family dynamics</li>
                <li>Children's changing developmental needs</li>
                <li>School considerations and extracurricular commitments</li>
                <li>Parents' changing work schedules</li>
                <li>Safety concerns</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Prenuptial and Postnuptial Agreements</h2>
              <p>
                Marital agreements serve an important role in protecting assets, clarifying financial expectations, and reducing conflict if divorce occurs. Our attorneys draft sophisticated prenuptial and postnuptial agreements that:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Protect premarital assets and inheritances</li>
                <li>Define separate and marital property</li>
                <li>Address business interests and professional practices</li>
                <li>Establish spousal support provisions or waivers</li>
                <li>Protect family wealth and estate planning goals</li>
                <li>Clarify financial responsibilities during marriage</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                We ensure these agreements meet Colorado's legal requirements for enforceability while fairly protecting both parties' interests.
              </p>

              <h2>Post-Decree Contempt and Enforcement</h2>
              <p>
                When a former spouse fails to comply with court orders, legal remedies exist. We represent clients seeking to enforce orders regarding:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Child support payment obligations</li>
                <li>Spousal maintenance</li>
                <li>Property division requirements</li>
                <li>Parenting time violations</li>
                <li>Decision-making authority disputes</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Contempt proceedings can result in various remedies including payment orders, makeup parenting time, attorney fee awards, and even jail time for willful violations.
              </p>

              <h2>Civil Protection Orders</h2>
              <p>
                In situations involving domestic abuse, harassment, or credible threats, civil protection orders provide legal protection. Our attorneys assist both petitioners seeking protection orders and respondents defending against allegations. We understand the serious implications these orders carry for family relationships, employment, firearm rights, and criminal consequences.
              </p>

              <h2>Common Law Marriage</h2>
              <p>
                Colorado recognizes common law marriage, but establishing or disproving such marriages requires specific evidence. We handle cases involving:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Establishing common law marriage for divorce purposes</li>
                <li>Defending against common law marriage claims</li>
                <li>Property division when common law marriage is disputed</li>
                <li>Clarifying when relationships became marital</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Why Choose Neiley & Morris for Family Law</h2>

              <h3>Comprehensive Service</h3>
