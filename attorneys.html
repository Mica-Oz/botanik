              <h2>Sarah M. Neiley, Attorney</h2>
              <p>
                Sarah is a Family Law practitioner. She represents clients in
                matters of dissolution of marriage, parenting rights and
                responsibilities, modifications of spousal and child support,
                post-decree custody disputes, and family law appeals. Sarah
                handles sophisticated family matters involving the analysis and
                litigation of high asset marital estates, property and business
                valuations, complex incomes, complicated custodial issues, and
                prenuptial and postnuptial marital agreements. Sarah understands
                the importance of her clients’ legal matters and how her work
                has long-lasting impacts in their lives and the lives of their
                families. As such, Sarah’s legal strategy and case management
                are client-driven. Sarah assists her clients in making informed,
                conscientious, and reasoned decisions to best achieve their
                goals. Sarah completed her undergraduate studies at the
                University of Colorado at Boulder in 2007, where she obtained a
                B.A. in both English Literature and Spanish, graduating with the
                highest honor and distinction of summa cum laude. After taking a
                few years to travel and work in the magazine industry, Sarah
                attended the University of Denver, Sturm College of Law where
                she served as a senior editor on The Denver Law Review, earning
                her J.D. in 2012. During the early stages of her career, Sarah
                was a criminal prosecutor in Colorado’s rural and urban
                jurisdictions. Sarah successfully managed and prosecuted
                hundreds, if not thousands, of criminal matters ranging from
                simple misdemeanors to felony offenses that included domestic
                violence, child abuse, sexual assault, and homicide. After
                leaving the government, Sarah entered private practice and
                worked for one of the largest law firms on the Western Slope as
                an associate in the firm’s family law and civil litigation
                departments. After starting a family of her own and recognizing
                her true legal interests, Sarah founded Aspen Valley Law, P.C.
                in 2019 with the intent of providing focused and efficient legal
                representation to family law litigants.
