            Sarah represents clients in sophisticated family matters involving
            the analysis and litigation of high asset marital estates, property
            and business valuations, complex incomes, challenging parenting
            issues, and prenuptial and postnuptial marital agreements. Though
            Sarah represents clients with sophisticated legal issues, she is
            equally passionate about her less complex cases. FAMILY
            RELATIONSHIPS AND FAMILY SYSTEMS ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO INDIVIDUAL
            WELLNESS AND SUCCESS. FOR THIS REASON, THE LEGAL ISSUES THAT AFFECT
            FAMILIES ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. Sarah understands the importance
            of her clients’ legal matters and how her work has long- lasting
            impacts in their lives and the lives of their families. She has an
            in-depth understanding of the legal issues her clients face and the
            experience to navigate them soundly by engaging in high-level
            analysis, strategizing, and problem-solving. Sarah guides her
            clients to make informed and carefully-considered decisions. In
            family law, RESOLUTION COMES IN MANY FORMS AND LOOKS DIFFERENT FOR
            EVERY CLIENT. Sarah prides herself on listening to her clients and
            understanding their needs and goals to inform a strategy of
            client-oriented resolution. She encourages her clients to reach
            out-of-court settlements when possible and enjoys working with her
            clients and opposing parties to find creative resolutions. Sarah
            believes it is critical to provide her clients with direct and
            honest advice about where to focus their time, energy, and money in
            litigating family law issues. Most of Sarah’s cases settle through
            negotiated agreements. However, when settlement is not possible,
            Sarah fervently advocates for her clients in court where she is a
            fierce opponent due to her extensive career as a trial attorney.
             During the early stages of her career, Sarah was a criminal
            prosecutor for the State of Colorado in both rural and metropolitan
            districts. She successfully managed and prosecuted hundreds, if not
            thousands, of criminal matters ranging from simple misdemeanors to
            felony offenses. After leaving the government, Sarah entered private
            practice and worked for one of the largest law firms on the Western
            Slope of Colorado as an associate in the firm’s family law and civil
            litigation departments. After starting a family of her own and
            recognizing her true passion for family law, Sarah founded and
            managed her own family law firm for five years before forming Neiley
            &amp; Morris. Sarah has personally tried over 60 cases, and she has
            taken even more cases to evidentiary hearings and hearings on legal
            argument. Due to her experience working in various jurisdictions and
            her unique background in family, civil,and criminal law, SARAH HAS
            THE SKILLSET AND ACUMEN TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE, RESOLVE, AND LITIGATE
            HER CLIENT’S LEGAL ISSUES. Sarah and the legal team at Neiley &amp;
            Morris are dedicated to providing family law litigants with
            compassionate and efficient legal representation.

            Mackenzie is a dedicated Criminal Defense and Family Law Attorney who prioritizes
            client-centered representation, focusing on long-term outcomes that align with her clients&#39; needs.
            With extensive experience in complex litigation, she has successfully represented clients in
            numerous trials and hearings throughout Colorado. While she values efficient resolutions and
            settlements when appropriate, her track record showcases her commitment to achieving
            favorable results in high-stakes cases.
            Mackenzie’s passion for criminal defense was ignited early in her career when she joined
            a team of attorneys representing one of the three inmates on Colorado’s Death Row. This pivotal
            experience fueled her dedication to defending the constitutional rights of the accused and
            advocating against systemic abuses within the criminal justice system. She approaches
            each case with thorough legal analysis, empowering her clients to make informed
            decisions—whether negotiating a plea agreement or mounting a robust defense in front of a jury.
            Before entering private practice, Mackenzie served as a Deputy Public Defender for the
            State of Colorado, where she represented hundreds of individuals charged wigh a wide range of
            crimes, from attempted homicide and sex assaults, to DUIs and minor drug offenses. This
            background has sharpened her litigation and negotiation skills, making her a compassionate and
            effective advocate in family law as well. Most of Mackenzie’s family law cases result in
            efficient settlements, as she strives to find creative solutions that lead to equitable
            outcomes and minimize conflict for families. Mackenzie is consistently praised by her clients
            for her attention to detail and her ability to provide comfort and support while her clients navigate
            the emotional complexities of family law.
            Mackenzie earned her law degree from the University of Denver Sturm College of Law,
            where she was honored as the Outstanding Student Attorney in Criminal Defense from the
            nationally ranked criminal defense clinic. During her time in law school, she also received the
            
            Public Good Distinction Award, the Reece Persuasive Writing Award, was the recipient of two
            scholarships for trial advocacy, and served as President of the Public Interest Law Group. Prior to
            her legal studies, she earned a B.A. in Political Science and International Studies from the
            University of Colorado and worked as a legislative representative for a state-wide nonprofit.
            Outside of her legal practice, Mackenzie is an avid outdoor enthusiast. She enjoys
            mountain biking, fishing, snowboarding, rafting, and is a dedicated hiker who has summited many
            of Colorado’s 14ers. Mackenzie loves to travel and has hiked across the world, including a 130-
            mile trek to Everest Base Camp.

                Zoe is one of the firm’s paralegals. Though Zoe works in all areas of practice, her main
                practice area is Family Law. She is a critical member of our Legal Team who has a keen
                eye and natural ability to identify and analyze important facts, evidence, legal issues.
                Zoe works with efficiency and is dedicated to ensuring that our team and clients are
                prepared and equipped to achieve resolution, whether through a negotiated settlement
                or court hearing. Zoe provides great care and understanding to our clients who enjoy
                working with her and know that she is invested in their individual cases and successes.
                Zoe began working as a paralegal with our attorneys in early 2022. Prior to working as
                a paralegal, Zoe held the positions of both Account Clerk and Court Clerk for the
                Garfield County Combined Courts. During her time as a clerk, Zoe gained intimate
                familiarity with the court’s documentation and filing processes, and she was responsible
                for managing and balancing the court’s registry account for the entire Ninth Judicial
                District. Zoe is a native of the Roaring Fork Valley, and in combination with her
                background as a court clerk, her knowledge and resourcefulness are great assets to our
                firm and clients.
