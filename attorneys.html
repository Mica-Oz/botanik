              Sarah represents clients in sophisticated family matters
            </span>
            involving the analysis and litigation of high asset marital estates,
            property and business valuations, complex incomes, challenging
            parenting issues, and prenuptial and postnuptial marital agreements.
            Though Sarah represents clients with sophisticated legal issues, she
            is equally passionate about her less complex cases.
            <strong
              >Family relationships and family systems are fundamental for
              individual wellness and success. For this reason, the legal issues
              that affect families are critically important.
            </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Sarah understands the importance of her clients’ legal matters and
            how her work has long- lasting impacts in their lives and the lives
            of their families. She has an in-depth understanding of the legal
            issues her clients face and the experience to navigate them soundly
            by engaging in high-level analysis, strategizing, and
            problem-solving. Sarah guides her clients to make informed and
            carefully-considered decisions.
            <strong
              >In family law, resolution comes in many forms and looks different
              for every client.</strong
            >
            Sarah prides herself on listening to her clients and understanding
            their needs and goals to inform a strategy of client-oriented
            resolution. She encourages her clients to reach out-of-court
            settlements when possible and enjoys working with her clients and
            opposing parties to find creative resolutions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sarah believes it is critical to provide her clients with direct and
            honest advice about where to focus their time, energy, and money in
            litigating family law issues. Most of Sarah’s cases settle through
            negotiated agreements. However, when settlement is not possible,
            Sarah fervently advocates for her clients in court where she is a
            fierce opponent due to her extensive career as a trial attorney.  
          </p>

          <p>
            During the early stages of her career, Sarah was a criminal
            prosecutor for the State of Colorado in both rural and metropolitan
            districts. She successfully managed and prosecuted hundreds, if not
            thousands, of criminal matters ranging from simple misdemeanors to
            felony offenses. After leaving the government, Sarah entered private
            practice and worked for one of the largest law firms on the Western
            Slope of Colorado as an associate in the firm’s family law and civil
            litigation departments. After starting a family of her own and
            recognizing her true passion for family law, Sarah founded and
            managed her own family law firm for five years before forming Neiley
            &amp; Morris.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sarah has personally tried over 60 cases, and she has taken even
            more cases to evidentiary hearings and hearings on legal
            argument. Due to her experience working in various jurisdictions and
            her unique background in family, civil, and criminal law,
            <strong>
              Sarah has the skillset and acumen to effectively manage, resolve,
              and litigate her client's legal issues.</strong
            >
            Sarah and the legal team at Neiley &amp; Morris are dedicated to
            providing family law litigants with compassionate and efficient
            legal representation.

              Mackenzie is a dedicated Criminal Defense and Family Law Attorney </span
            >who prioritizes client-centered representation, focusing on
            long-term outcomes that align with her clients' needs. With
            extensive experience in complex litigation, she has successfully
            represented clients in numerous trials and hearings throughout
            Colorado. While she values efficient resolutions and settlements
            when appropriate, her track record showcases her commitment to
            achieving favorable results in high-stakes cases.

            <br />
          </p>

          <p>
            Mackenzie’s passion for criminal defense was ignited early in her
            career when she joined a team of attorneys representing one of the
            three inmates on Colorado’s Death Row.
            <strong>
              This pivotal experience fueled her dedication to defending the
              constitutional rights of the accused and advocating against
              systemic abuses within the criminal justice system.</strong
            >
            She approaches each case with thorough legal analysis, empowering
            her clients to make informed decisions—whether negotiating a plea
            agreement or mounting a robust defense in front of a jury.

            <br />
          </p>

          <p>
            Before entering private practice, Mackenzie served as a Deputy
            Public Defender for the State of Colorado, where she represented
            hundreds of individuals charged wigh a wide range of crimes, from
            attempted homicide and sex assaults, to DUIs and minor drug
            offenses. This background has sharpened her litigation and
            negotiation skills, making her a compassionate and effective
            advocate in family law as well. Most of Mackenzie’s family law cases
            result in efficient settlements, as
            <strong
              >she strives to find creative solutions that lead to equitable
              outcomes and minimize conflict for families.
            </strong>

            <br />
          </p>

          <p>
            Mackenzie is consistently praised by her clients for her attention
            to detail and her ability to provide comfort and support while her
            clients navigate the emotional complexities of family law. Mackenzie
            earned her law degree from the University of Denver Sturm College of
            Law, where she was honored as the Outstanding Student Attorney in
            Criminal Defense from the nationally ranked criminal defense clinic.
            During her time in law school, she also received the Public Good
            Distinction Award, the Reece Persuasive Writing Award, was the
            recipient of two scholarships for trial advocacy, and served as
            President of the Public Interest Law Group. Prior to her legal
            studies, she earned a B.A. in Political Science and International
            Studies from the University of Colorado and worked as a legislative
            representative for a state-wide nonprofit.

            <br />
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of her legal practice, Mackenzie is an avid outdoor
            enthusiast. She enjoys mountain biking, fishing, snowboarding,
            rafting, and is a dedicated hiker who has summited many of
            Colorado’s 14ers. Mackenzie loves to travel and has hiked across the
            world, including a 130- mile trek to Everest Base Camp.

              Zoe is one of the firm’s paralegals. </span
            >Though Zoe works in all areas of practice, her main practice area
            is Family Law. She is a critical member of our Legal Team who has a
            keen eye and natural ability to identify and analyze important
            facts, evidence, legal issues. Zoe works with efficiency and is
            dedicated to ensuring that our team and clients are prepared and
            equipped to achieve resolution, whether through a negotiated
            settlement or court hearing. Zoe provides great care and
            understanding to our clients who enjoy working with her and know
            that she is invested in their individual cases and successes. Zoe
            began working as a paralegal with our attorneys in early 2022. Prior
            to working as a paralegal, Zoe held the positions of both Account
            Clerk and Court Clerk for the Garfield County Combined Courts.
            During her time as a clerk, Zoe gained intimate familiarity with the
            court’s documentation and filing processes, and she was responsible
            for managing and balancing the court’s registry account for the
            entire Ninth Judicial District. Zoe is a native of the Roaring Fork
            Valley, and in combination with her background as a court clerk, her
            knowledge and resourcefulness are great assets to our firm and
            clients.
